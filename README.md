Technical Committee

This repository contains (if anything) stuff that is probably not of interest to you unless you are a
member of the Nova Labs Technology Committee.  It exists primarily so that we can use the GitHub issue
tracker to manage technology committee tasks, since github issues is such a nice, friendly way to manage
these things.   ;)
